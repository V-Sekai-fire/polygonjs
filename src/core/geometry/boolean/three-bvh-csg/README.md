An _experimental, in progress_, flexible, memory compact, fast and dynamic CSG implementation on top of [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh). More than 100 times faster than other BSP-based three.js CSG libraries in complex cases.

Contributions welcome!

# Roadmap

- Fix triangle splitting / missing triangle issues
- Hierarchical operations [#6](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-bvh-csg/issues/6)
- Polygon splitting [#4](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-bvh-csg/issues/4)
- Worker Support [#14](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-bvh-csg/issues/14)

# Use

```js
import { SUBTRACTION, Brush, Evaluator } from 'three-bvh-csg';
import { MeshStandardMaterial, Mesh, SphereGeometry, BoxGeometry } from 'three';

const csgEvaluator = new Evaluator();
const brush1 = new Brush( new SphereGeometry() );
const brush2 = new Brush( new BoxGeometry() );

const result = csgEvaluator.evaluate( brush1, brush2, SUBTRACTION );

// render the result!
```

# API

## Constants

### Operations

CSG operations enums for use with `Evaluator`.

```
ADDITION
SUBTRACTION
DIFFERENCE
INTERSECTION
```

## Brush

_extends THREE.Mesh_

An object with the same interface as `THREE.Mesh` but used to evaluate CSG operations. Once a brush is created the geometry should not be modified.

> **Note**
> 
> It is recommended to remove groups from a geometry before creating a brush if multi-material support is not required.

## Operation

## Evaluator

### .useGroups

```js
useGroups = true : Boolean
```

Whether to use geometry groups when processing the geometry. If geometry groups are used then a material array and groups will be assigned to the target `Brush` after processing. If groups are disabled then a single coherent piece of geometry with no groups will be produced.

### .evaluate

```js
evaluate(
	brushA : Brush,
	brushB : Brush,
	operation : Operation,
	target = null : Brush | Mesh
) : Brush | Mesh
```

Performs the given `operation` on `brushA` with `brushB`. If no target is provided then a new `Brush` will be created with the new geometry. Otherwise the provided Brush will be _modified in place_ and geometry disposed or marked for update as needed.

# Gotchas
- All geometry are expected to have all attributes being used and of the same type.
- Geometry on a Brush should be unique and not be modified after being set.
